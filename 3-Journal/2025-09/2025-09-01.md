I have been sick for the past 2 days, and did not write my journal entries. I finished the book today and am feeling better. I had to cancel dnd, but that is ok, I have a lot do for debate. That is going to be very fun, but that is alright because I am the one that signed up for it. I do not think I will do all 200 words today, hell I will probably not even get close. But that is alright, it is better than nothing.

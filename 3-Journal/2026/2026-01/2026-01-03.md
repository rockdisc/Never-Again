I did more today, but not all that I wanted to do. Though I did have some things I did not think I had to do that were thrust on me, so I am not completely upset with myself. Tomorrow I must get more done. I decided I will not be continuing with Poet's land, it is not something I feel myself drawn to anymore as the other thing I have going is much better. I think I am able to understand myself better by learning more things, looking at my religion made me learn this. I think I am in things for the value that is given to me by them. I know that seems ordinary, but before, I thought I did things just because they were there. I am a go with the flow type of person, even though I love to plan. It seems contradictory, but that is just how humans are. This is how it is for me. I actually put pen to paper for making my magic system, and it seems to be working. There are so many more things that I am realizing I have to figure out because I did this. I think if I had this online, it would be overwhelming and I would not have done much because of that, but it seems like a mixed pressure on paper. I get the happiness of progress so I am not being overwhelmed.

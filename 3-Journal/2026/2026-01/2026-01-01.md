I am finally writing today. It has been a solid few months, I did some things, I did not do others, but I am here today because I want to keep the flow. More and more things are happening, so I made my first ever resolution, that is to write everyday. Am I going to keep it? who knows, but I would like to try. I am not going to try to play catch up, that is not why I have this journal, that is for the past. I am having a lot of different ideas of what to write, though it seems there is not enough time in a day to do all of them, I know why, but I do not think I can stop my screen time all in one go, but sure, I think I should be able to somehow. I need to prep for debate, I am falling into this loop of procrastination again, and I do not want that. I need to change for the better, but it seems so distant, I do not even have vision of who I want to be, but a fuzzy thought. This is the first step, of many, and I hope I take the rest.

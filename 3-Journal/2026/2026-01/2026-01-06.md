I just forgot to write yesterday, just completely slipped my mind, I am not that mad though as I got some things done that day. School started and I got my secret Santa gift, it is a really nice notebook, I am using it already, I think it will be a main stay unless something unforeseen happens. School is going fine, though I am actually getting things to do, I do not like that now as I also want to work on my map. I started that and realized that I really do not know that much about ocean currents or anything related to geology, so in my free time I am starting to compile the data I know into that new notebook, eventually it will get online, but that is not any time soon as I am having a field day hand writing things. I wish I had good enough handwriting so that AI will be able to copy it over, but that is not the case, sometimes even I myself cannot read it. I think it is soon time that I improve my handwriting, it should not be that hard, just time consuming. That is also the issue now, I have so many things to do that I do not know if I have time for everything. I think I should start tracking my time and setting those timers again so I get more time.

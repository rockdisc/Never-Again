I did one of the things I wanted to do today, and another I had to do. I am not happy with this, but I am not sad either. I am getting more ideas of what to do for the book. Each rough draft is better than the last. My previous one was way too over complicated, it feels like too much to put into a magic system. It feels more like I am shaping the square hole to be a circle than carving the circle to be a square. And the times I want to keep the circle its shape, I cannot put it in the square hole. I think a restart is in order, though I do not know how much that will do in the betterment of the story, but it will for my own self interest. It seems this is all a really thought about today, outside of the work I had to do. What am I doing? really. I am hoping for better weather tomorrow, I need a walk. It seems like it will not be the case, though I might just walk anyway. I have been watching Mushi-shi, it is very good, it has been giving me a lot to think about.

I did more worldbuilding today. What I should have done is did debate work, because now so much piled up that I do not know how to do all of it in one day, though if I know myself, I will somehow manage to get it done. I have coffee saved for tomorrow which I went to get today, but I do not know if it will be enough. Tomorrow will be very nice so I will go out for a walk, and I think I might fix my toothbrush. It has become more of a symbol to me than an asset. There are more things I need to take notes on, but priorities exist, though I will be doing my writing and worldbuilding before the debate work knowing myself. School is starting again, I wanted to do more things over the break, but I am happy with the things that were done. It seems like if I keep myself to doing one thing productive a day in each category, I get things done. I think I will try that.

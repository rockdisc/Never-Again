# 2025-10-02

I am writing this late again. I really do not want to do that, but it seems I have to. At least it is not that late. There is a lot I want to do, but I have a tournament tomorrow and barely put together my aff. Tomorrow will include a lot of aff work as I a assuming that the class will be pretty silence. Now that I think about it, it will probably not be. Taking my headphones to school was one of the best ideas I had in a while. It let me focus a lot better and more things got done. I just wish I had some time in the day where I can just relax and write things, but most of that is in class where I can't just wear my headphones and enter the zone. I am slowly getting back into the flow of this, it is really helping me calm down at the end of my days. Maybe I should start planning my days again. If I did one of those things it would probably be really nice, not needing to think but just do. Though I do not know how well that would work.

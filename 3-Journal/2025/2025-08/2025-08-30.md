Guess who is sick today. It is just my luck to get sick during the one weekend where I have a lot of work to do. I also want to draw trees with houses in them. I am watching a video with a dude building them in Minecraft, but I do not have the time to play right now, so I will settle with just drawing them. I got a lot to do tomorrow, I will see if I can convince my parents to let me stay and not go to legends. Though I still do want to go and get the tickets and new shoes. I have to work on debate stuff, finish session planning, finish astronomy vocab, do physics practice problems, take lang notes, and read my book. It is a lot to do, but I will not be free the other days. Watching videos is entertaining, but I have that nagging feeling again of wanting to do things but not being able, or willing at the moment, to do them. Like yes I can work on the session planning right now, but it is better to focus on sleeping early and getting rid of my sickness. All of this is thoughts for tomorrow though.

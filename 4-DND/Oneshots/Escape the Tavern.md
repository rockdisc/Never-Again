#DND  #OneShot
## Setting 
“A man dies twice, first when his body dies, and again when he is forgotten”

“But a god only dies once”

Gods can only die if they are forgotten by their worshipers, the less people that know them the less power they have

False hydras can make people forget things, if a false hydra eats a person praying to a god, it can make everyone in its song’s range forget about the god, in a big city this can greatly decrease a gods power even kill one

Seeing this, the gods realized that they can be used offensively by demons

Though this maybe called an overreaction the gods banish every building that has a false hydra in it

The gods found a devil placing a placing a false hydra seed in this tavern and instantly banished it, the devil thought of all the spells he had and realized that the only one that could get him out was dimensional door, which started this whole thing

People are stuck in tavern in the celestial sea

They get there by randomly opening a door

Make it scary

# How to Run 
This is a sandbox one-shot and it would benefit if the players do not know what a false hydra is. Things will happen as time passes, be sure to think of the time as things are happening. So look at this map with where all the people are and know the interactions. Each character(or group of characters) have an appearance, backstory, and goal. Unless stopped by the players, these goals will happen. Players should be level 1, all combat encounters should be hard and not their first choice.

## Timed Events 

Day 1: Nobles discussion of prince murder 
Night 1: half of Gary gone 
Day 2: Explanation of False Hydra and Prince asks for help 
Night 2: Clergyman and Tavernkeeper gone, Attack on prince 
Day 3: Sees a black orb in the distance. By night it reaches outside of the tavern and it stays. It looks like a hole in space leading to somewhere. 
Night 3: If not prepared Jerry, the Leywins, and Jess will be eaten. The players can lay a trap using the glyph of warding. That will blow a hole in the tavern letting them fully see the giant black hole, they will need so somehow push the false hydra in. 

Statblocks are for losers.

#DND/Session/Misadventurers 

In the actual forest:

A pole that has magic on it, a bunch of little bugs

Go to a log cabin that has 3 people in it, all of them forgot their names, they forget a lot of things here

Trap- Tall crusty, tying up a trap

Book- chubby scars throughout his arms, reading, forgot how to walk

Fold- outgoing crazy, has blindfolds and booze

They don't care about you, just your roommates until the cult is delt with

Fold will be your eyes in the forest

Cannot long rest because of the dream visage fog

Trap tells them about the regular monsters:

The dream visage(blindfolds)

Trolls (they are fleeing now though)

 the screamers

Book tells them about the trails and marks

Fold tells them about the new threats:

The mage rippers

Mimics

Chanting

He also tells them what happens when looking in the [[Visage King]]

They sleep, hear screams in the distance and they dream of their favorite dreams, absolute bliss

When they wake up, around the afternoon, Book shows them where they last found cult activity.  Near the mountain

2 paths to take, one by the ruins is faster but more dangerous, the dead giant one will make them have to rest before going but will be easier to navigate

It is dangerous because of it is near water, water is the breeding ground of the Power Leaches

Before they go Trap tells them to not talk to any people on the trail they are more than likely not real

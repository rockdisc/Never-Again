#DND/Ors/Spirits 

After prolonged use of [[Spirits]]. [[Users]] begin start the process of [[Embroidment]]. If they were to continue, as in use their spirit several times a day. There is a chance for devourment when a spirit completely takes over their user. 

The common understanding of Devourment is actually of Total Devourment, where the spirit goes out of control along with the user leading to a natural [[Disaster]] developing. 

But in actuality it is more complicated then that. Devourment is just when a person loses control to their spirit. This is how [[Jotuns]] are created. 

[[Sterkgalinn]] are formed when the user dies and are welcomed into the major arcana when they get past their total devourment.

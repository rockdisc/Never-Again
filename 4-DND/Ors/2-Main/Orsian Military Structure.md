Tools of [[Abaddon]], the 12-Armed God, which are used not just for the military structure but also for the government, as most of the arms are dedicated to the military. These are:

For both cultural reasons and secrecy, each tool has a different ranking system. Although the Arourans have already cracked it, it does nothing but confuse the Shield and common public. It will be laid out here:

- Shield – Numbered order from 5 to 1, with each managing different things; 1 is the King himself.
    
- Scythe – Not much is known, even within the army, but it seems ranks are based on the number of kills, reflected by the condition of the scythe: from clean (lowest) to rotten (highest). “Pristine” seems to be the highest rank, held by only one person.
    
- Orb – The Head Director is the highest position. There are several teams with different projects, each led by a team lead.
    
- Staff – The region’s mages have several towers with 10 layers each. There is a head for each tower (e.g., Head of the 10th Layer of the Necromantic Tower).
    
- Trident – Three prongs: trade/protection (15 fleets), attack (30 fleets), and defense (15 fleets), each led by admirals, with captains for each fleet.
    
- Bident – Two prongs for consumers and producers; no leadership structure.
    
- Sword – Several legions based on blade types, with leaders called heads of blades: Knife, Short Sword, Saber, Rapier, and Broadsword, ranked from lowest to highest.
    
- Axe – No formal order, just a rotating leader,   (White Bear).
    
- Pickaxe – Head of individual mines; no overall structure.
    
- Hammer – Head of individual smitheries; no overall structure, though smithers get widely recognized titles for their creations.
    
- Bow – Different arrows represent different groups, each with a head. The Head of the Bow can see through anyone’s eyes when he activates his ability.
    
- Spear – The Party and adventurers with ranks, taken from the Southern concept but not directly controlled by [[Cans]] of the South.

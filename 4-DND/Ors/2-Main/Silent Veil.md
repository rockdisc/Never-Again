The user can cast a power word like spell infused with their speaking. The longer they remain silent, the more powerful the spell is. EX: "Stop" will make a person stop whatever they are doing at a low level, and stop breathing, or even their heartbeat at a higher level(around a week of silence). It is not only limited to words in the power word list. The duration are for a 1/100 of the time spent silent. Or as a magnitude, depending on how the user uses it. 

A person cannot speak while wearing it.

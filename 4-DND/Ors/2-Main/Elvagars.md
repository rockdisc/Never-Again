Supported by [[Cor]], they are ocean dwelling people that live in their city of [[Elvaghiem]] which borders on the [[Maelstrom]]. They use it to propel themselves to distant locations. They are not [[Users]], instead when they go to find their [[Spirits]], they kill and eat their spirit. This allows them to interact with spirit directly, while also giving them the power their spirit had, but it cannot grow, it will be the same for whenever they get it. This is why most go on quests when they are physically the fittest. They are not weak before this as they are able to create [[Artifact]]s, which are made from dead people, they do this to their ancestors to get more powers. They also do this to their enemies. For this reason, both the church and the government does not like them. Little do people know but [[Aegir]] lived with these people.

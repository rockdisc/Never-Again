### Plot Hooks

betrayed by the arouran mercinary group 


## Backstory
Fisherman who finds a pearl the size of a pool ball. He tires to sell it at a local vendor but they try to threaten him into giving it to them but I run away. That night a group of bandits sneak into my house. I am alerted by the screaming of my family so I go into the living room and attack to bandits. They already killed my family and in the attack I lost my eye. Cry myself to sleep after killing the bandits. 
I awaken in a jail cell and told that I was convinced of stealing a pearl and because I was a part of a poor family and the merchant was rich, he just pated off the judge and the judge agreed because my family was sort of a hermit so no one would care about us anyways and they wanted my land because it was sea front land and they wanted to use it as land to attract upper-class residents. My arm was placed in a furnace until all that remained of my forearm was bones and the biceps touching the furnace was seriously burned. 
The Judge knew I did not commit the murder as well but still convicted me of it because he could not steal my land with just a theft charge, but because he knew I was innocent he let me live. The spring near the jail suddenly had a surge of pressure(Spirit) which broke the jail wall. 
I stole back the pearl from the merchant during the escape. My spirit became bonded to the pearl was the reason for my suffering and the reason I had to start a new life.
I joined the mercenary group for money because I was a vagabond. I gained enough influence to found my own mercenary group and I only took on requests to kill thieves(not petty), assassins, and corrupt government officials. I did this as a sort of revenge.
I originally lived in the area on the other army but my military faction became too strong for an unaffiliated army that anyone could buy so the government killed most of my men in a scandal, they hired us to attack a caravan and they knew er would camp on the cliff overlooking the caravan because there was a rat in the mercenary group and they put bombs all around the cliff, went into a 3 year coma after the accident and one of my men brought me to [[Michael Leech]]'s clinic until I woke up.

Created by [[Michael Leech]] for the Orsian government. They enable [[Users]] to be able to use their [[Spirits]] for more turns. The downsides to this are that if they use it more than once, every consecutive time they use it they will lose a turn forever. It will also further their [[Embroidment]], It makes it easier for a person to be [[Devourment|devoured]].

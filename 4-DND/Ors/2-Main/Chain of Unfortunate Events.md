#DND/Ors/Artifact #Worldbuilding/Item 

It causes misfortune to everyone in a 10 meter radius. This means disadvantage on all rolls. Along with a small version of [[Murphy's Law]]

It affects the user as well. Along with people tied to the user in some way. Long term use can lead to a pessimistic view on life. 

There are only 2 people not affected by this in their semi. [[Michael Leech]] and [[Zayn]]

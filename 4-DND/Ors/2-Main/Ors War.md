The conflict is being fought between the Arourans and the Orsians over a dispute regarding how to treat sprites. The North believes sprites should be treated as partners and even encourages polygamy and marriage with them, in accordance with their religious beliefs. The South, on the other hand, has adopted a new religion from further south and practices a different form of magic, often referred to as Southy Magic. They view sprites more as tools or contractual sources of power.

The war is believed to have started when the Prince of Freki was to marry the Princess of Torg. However, when the princess arrived, she mysteriously died.

The Arourans claim the princess was either already dead upon arrival, possibly killed by someone from her entourage, or that she was morally corrupt, and the prince’s sprite killed her.

The Orsians argue that the princess took her own life in despair after learning the prince was spiritually married to his sprite, and she feared committing a religious sin.

The conflict was further intensified by a season of heavy rainfall that led to widespread flooding in the South, resulting in a poor harvest and significant loss of life across the region. This event came to be known as the Diluvium.

Once the war began, it lasted for ten years until reaching a stalemate. The Arourans conquered the entire North, while the Orsians united the South. Although raids and smaller skirmishes continued, the larger battles involving powerful magic users eventually ceased. This was due to an impasse: the neutral Mint Hook Mountain people refused to take sides. Their allegiance could tip the war, as they control the creation of currency and maintain the gold standard. Both regions still use the same currency in hopes of gaining favor with the Mountain people.

For the past fifteen years, the war has remained at a standstill, with both sides attempting to gain influence over the mountains through peaceful means. The Arourans arrived first and, under orders from the Head Commander, advanced peacefully into a few towns—until resistance began. The Orsians were then compelled to also advance peacefully; if they showed too much aggression, the Mountain people would likely support the North.

Over these fifteen years, there have been hundreds of diplomatic talks and several suppressed insurrections in the region. Whether these uprisings were genuine or orchestrated remains unknown.

#DND/Ors/Spirits 

There are 3 types of sprites:

- [[Trow]]- Earth spirits that are stubborn and effect the individual
- [[Nixie]]- Water spirits that go with the flow and effect others
- [[Sylph]]- Air spirits that make changes and effect surroundings

Because of lore reasons(go to Religion) every person born in Ors also causes a change in the land, a new river forming, an earthquake forming a hill, and the such. This then also gives birth to a sprite, and this sprite is assigned to that person. Many people never find there sprites, but around the age of 15(go to Religion for more details) everyone goes searching for their spirit, the type of spirit is decided on what type of person that person is. If they are stubborn they get a Trow, if they strive for change they get a Sylph, and if they can adapt but do not actively go for change they get a Nixie. Though this is being challenged in the modern day by philosophers saying that people can change how they act letter in life.

Once you find your sprite, you can bond to it in various means. The Arourans go through a ritual that differs per sprite but involves the sharing of bodily fluids. The Orsians on the other hand take it as a contract with signing and the such.

Most people keep their sprites visible for it lets them travel and interact with the world, while others, specifically people in active combat, or people with powerful sprites keep them invisible to most people, but some are able to see them as stronger sprite users can see weaker sprites to a certain degree based on their level of strength.

Though this power and the sprites are located almost nowhere else in the world due to the false goddess Umberlee of the Sea despising any sprite user for no apparent reason. The moment a sprite or user goes outside the protection of the mountains, legions of sea dwellers and the waves themselves start attacking

### Uses

After a person bonds to their sprite, they will be bonded for life(maybe even afterlife as said in the old religion). While the sprite gets to interact with the mortal world, we get to use their powers, an even trade. These powers are distinct to each spirit.

#### Semi-Possession

Aka Semi-Equip/Union Releases a smaller version of the power as the sprite fuses with your body to give it a material shape but not completely so it can go on for longer but weaker. This also improves based on Level

Semi-Possession turns double as a modifier for Sprite checks, they are used for if 2 sprites are controlling one object or saving throws against your sprite.

**Spirit Check modifier**

= your remaining semi turns

#### Full-Possession

Aka Full-Equip/Union Releases the most power the sprite can while not directly damaging the user. It does this by being almost completely material by fusing with the user. Though it this is used often it causes _[[Embroidment]]_, some people, after very frequent use(5 times a day or more), get consumed by their spirit, this is called _[[Devourment]]_. **Players can only use full once, and semi twice per day, unless taking spiritualist class.**

Full takes 2 turns to charge before use [bonus to start, action used to chant, Full is activated] Though this can be lowered by Spiritualist features.

To activate full possession you need to say a chant that relates to what type the sprite is, you need to do this to go through the spiritual inertia by calling a god’s name. It starts with:

- Trow- On [[Abaddon]]’s Order
- Sylph- By [[Boreal]]’s Breath
- Nixie- For [[Cor]]’s Crown

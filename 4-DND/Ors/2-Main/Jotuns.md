They live in [[Jotunheim]] within the [[Sandstorm]] is the [[Mint Hook Mountains]] where they have a meritocracy where the strongest are the top.

Their power structure is that of tarot cards. The major arcana are the [[Sterkgalinn]] and the minor arcana are jotuns, also referred to as Eotens.

Normal jotuns have both their user and spirit alive. When the user dies, so does the spirit, but a few can survive and become the minor arcana. When they go past their devourment is when they are able to become a part of the major arcana. 

Minor arcana have always active semi possession and the major arcana have full possession always on

There are only 22 and 56 respectively because the way they survive is by eating the [[Spirit Sigil]] that is on their bodies.

#Worldbuilding/Item #DND/Ors/Artifact 

Allows for one to change their appearance, voice, and all other noticeable features such as unconscious habits of the person it copies, though not their powers whether it be their magic, spirit, or knowledge. The mask does not have a reflection so a person looking at a mirror can see the person underneath it. 

The user takes 3d6 psychic damage every day they wear it(They cannot wear it for the next day to recover), 6d6 damage if they ever see the person they are copying while wearing the mask.

#DND/Ors/Artifact #Worldbuilding/Item 

For every 100 hard truths said while having contact with this artifact, one lie will become true. A stronger Wish. 

## Drawback

It resets even if you do not have it equip if one says a lie. Unlike other [[Artifact]]s, even if a a person only touches it, its effects will activate. They only deactivate after 10 lies are told. Each time a lie is told, they take psychic damage based on how important the lie it. Just saying a joke will deal 1d4, something like saying your name is not your name in an investigation leads to 6d6 damage. There is also a figure that shows up if a person who holds it a long time, like sin of solace, but always positive, about everyone.

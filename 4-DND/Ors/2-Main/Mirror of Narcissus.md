It creates a copy of the user. It is alive and has the same intelligence as the user. It lasts for as long as the user wants. It activates when the user looks into the mirror and deactivates when the user is holding the mirror and says something to the effect of "go away."
## Drawback 

The mirror person wants to be in the real world. They very much dislike whoever has the mirror. Depending on the personality of the user, they might even attack everyone around them as they technically have no consequences in the real world.

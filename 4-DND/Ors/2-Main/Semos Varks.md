## Summary
He is a very well known noble from the old families of Jakt. He is part of [[Abaddon's Armor]], which is trying to bring back the old glory of the nations. He is on a mission to convince the people of smaller cities to join the old nations again. He is not liked by [[Bardri]], but after the party took care of him, those people now work under him. 

### Faction(s):Orsian 
One of the [[Variables]]

## Power(s):
Sancus 
[[Nixie]]
He has the ability to convince anyone to do whatever he wants that he directly interacts with. They will also think of him as a good person that was a great help to them. They will also hate people that go against them. Though this power does not work if the victim does not like him to begin with. It works if they are neutral, but not if they do not like him. 

He carries an [[Artifact]] which allows him to change how he looks with him to better fit what he wants.

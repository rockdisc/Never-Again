### Coming of Age

After a few months of being together, [[Egdir]] and [[4-DND/Ors/2-Main/Thalia]] gave birth to their first and only child, [[Aegir]]. As he was growing up he was growing to be stubborn and spoiled, so when he turned 14 Egdir sent him down to the [[Material realm]] to mature and see the way they live. Egdir told Aegir that he had to find and master his spirit, maybe even find a wife before it comes back. After 10 years, Aegir returns with all of that. Now we send all of our children to explore and find their spirit.

### War and Battle

As the Original War is dead, the position laid empty, but not for long, as the gods soon turned it into a posititon of power for the humans to achieve. They did this to quell the uproar of the “evil” gods as they wanted equal representation. So, the gods made it so that any warlord or military leader would become the god of war after their death if they were the most popular, infamous, hated, or loved. This position has changed countless times, but as of now, it is held by the previous king or Ors, the great King Gylfi.

### Heroic Myths

While Aegir was on the Material world, he went on several quest. The main 5 were when the king made him do tasks around the kingdom. They were:

- Catch 2 giant ravens
- Brave the Sandstorm and get a Desert Daisy
- Bring back a ring from the Evagian Augar
- Bring back a lock of hair from the Sea
- Kill the incarnations of Boreal, Kors, and Abbadon

### Other Myths

Nonsentient species born in Ors steal spirits from the sentient species.

The moon is made of bones sent up there by Boreal

### Other Cultures

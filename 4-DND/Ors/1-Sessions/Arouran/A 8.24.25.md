# Summary

They start walking into the office of [[Thrainn Dval]], who they had heard a lot about, but never have seen before. Well, someone with military background has been seen before. 

You are part of a mercenary guild, but the last few quests they gave there were a test. They were orchestrated by Thrainn to find the people who could complete his quest. 

As they open up the door, it takes a dc 10 strength check, a pile of papers gets shoved aside. There is so much loose paper that it seems the room is made of it. 

They see an older man with greying hair peek out from behind the biggest pile, he examines them for a bit, then busts out laughing. 2 more heads, from either side of the room now look outside their papers, on man, one woman, both younger. The girl starts to laugh while the guy is confused. 

The girl is [[Serafin Fitz]], who can see the most likely future of anyone she sees.
The guy is [[Barlo Eden]], can analyze the things and learn more about them, just by hearing their name.

The 2 are laughing because they realized that the people that have the highest chance of winning the war are the same people that have the highest chance of destroying it. 

He explains to them their quest: 
1. Gain control of [[Kyling]] by talks before he dies 
	1. Along the way find and collect [[Users]] to fight for the army. You can do this by giving them a piece of paper which lets us take control of them only if they are willing. They can become willing by force. 
	2. In [[Glasir]] they will find [[Lain]] the previous commander, convince him to come back and take the place of Thrainn 
2. Await further instructions

They can ask him questions. 

He gives them the ![[Scribe's Accomplice]]

Thrainn has the [[King's Accomplice]], while they do not know who has the [[Jester's Accomplice]], they have never seen a message from it, though they can sense that someone owns it and the spirituality coming from the accomplices is a bit weird, nothing to worry about. As long as the person they want to send over signs the paper with their actually signature, they can be teleported over. 

Explain what an [[Artifact]] is to everyone if they do not already know. He tells them 2 quick things, 
1. do not use [[Pusher]]s
2. He tells them they are going to be called the Tail, there used to be a previous tail, but they are no longer in the army. Asks if they have any more questions before sending them off:

He wishes that [[Boreal]] keep them safe. TAP YOUR SHOLDERS WITH YOUR HAND. 

## Travel 


### Within City:

1. A guy runs up to them, a half-orc, beaten and disheveled. He seems to be sniffing the air and asks them if they can give him some [[Shade]]. He will first give them a sob story of being about to die, they try to give them a silver coin, finally he will try to attack them, though he is very easy to defeat.
2. The moment they get outside the Castletown they here something being written on the Scribe, It is the Fool, [[Vargris]], who asks them why they plan in his palm? They see the different handwriting. He pretends to be a person that got kicked out of the nation because he went against the will of Thrainn, what is more of a dictatorship, the South or the North?
3. As they pass next to a church of [[Abaddon]], they see people throwing stones up into the air next to it as they pass. They remember, specifically Aryan who is a missionary, that [[Boreal]] believers used to throw pieces of food there, if it landed on the church it would be good luck. It was a changed symbol of the fight between [[Abaddon]] and [[Boreal]], but now it has become degrading. A few kids come by with a large bag, it is filled with bones. They ask the party if they want to throw them at the church. The bones are of the people who died by the hands of the church, they would have wanted to get their deaths avenged, or so they say. 
It starts to snow as they leave.
### Day 1:

1. They meet [[Vextra the Trader]]
They see a trader caravan on their way going to Torg, she, [[Vextra the Trader]], an explorer that you remember hearing tavern tales about, asks of they want to buy anything, a discount on a few things she does not want to carry with her. 

A gem of single cast revivify which a person can use to cast revivify 1 time. 250 each, has 3

5 potions of healing (2d4) for 30 each

1 spell scroll(one time use) for any spell up to 5th level, aside from revivify, for cantrip 10, 1-50, 2-100, 3-150, 4-200, 5-250

She has spiritual power coming from her, though they cannot identify what power it is.
She says its the second time this week that a party tried to recruit her into the army 
==She can teleport anything she wants near her, has to include herself, anywhere she has been.==


2. They notice a poorly made trap in the road, it is a clump of snow and dirt that is not melting along with the rest. It is a pitfall, there is about 5 people with knives and bows in the forest on each side trying to rob them. They are believers of [[Abaddon]]

They will try to beg after they get caught. As they do, a few younger guys will try to shoot them from above. 

One of them as a small flintlock and tries to hit whoever is talking. 

They say that they are scared to go to Arklow because they heard rumors of people going crazy. 

3. They see a man walking from the river and hails them. He, [[Esqine Augean]], askes if they can give him a ride to Meols, he is willing to pay them in [[Artifact]]s.

He says that he knows how to make [[Artifact]]s and can make them for them if they let him hitch a ride. 
Some check will let them notice that he has been waiting from them there for a long time waiting for a long time, maybe waiting for a specific group of people. Strong [[Users]].
He cannot make any right now, but he tells them that after Meols, he will make them an amazing artifact. He will not tell them how they are made, or the details for what powers they will be, well that part he can discuss after they make the deal. 
To show his sincerity, he gives them one to start. 
![[Endless Spring]]
It is his most valuable [[Artifact]], he just asks to be able to use is as long as he is with them. 

### Day 2:

1. As they are camping they hear voices 
The camp itself is when [[Esqine Augean]] starts to talk to them. He is very bad at hiding that he is an [[Elvagars]]. He talks about the [[Augurs]] and asks questions that would be basic knowledge to anyone. 
As he talks, there are hushed voices in the woods. There is a pack of goblins that were planning to ambush them, there is one in the back sitting on a stump and talks like a mafia boss. When they get notices they run away and come back. 

2. They see horses running toward them, scared with no one on them. They look like horses used to drive a carriage.
They see a carriage flipped over with the horses gone. There are weird wet sounds coming from behind the carriage. There are 3 men that are taking bites out of dead people, when they see the party, they bark and attack. They were eating the bodies on all fours. One of them, the biggest one, has a ability. [[DogUser1]] has the ability to control the chains around his body for 3 turns. 

3. There is a man riding a horse, all by himself. 
When they pass by him, they see his spirituality move, he turns to them and asks if they are [[Users]]. He says that he sells [[Artifact]]s if they want to par ooze. [[Esqine Augean]] definitely wants to. The man leads them deep into the forest saying that he as an artifact that lets him pilot a fake body for a long distance and he is leading them to his true body. 
They get to a clearing where there is a 5 carriage long caravan driven by several horses, but only one man sitting there. He lets them look around, [[Esqine Augean]] seems to be murmuring under his breath as he looks at them. A check reveals that he is saying names. They find 3 that appeal to them. I am not making any more. 

![[Slumbering Veil]]
400g 

![[Muse's Mask]]
500g

![[Puppet's String]]
1000g

He will then try to get information about the church out of them, as this happens more and more, his demeaner starts to change. He is being controlled by [[Freja]]. With a spirituality check, they can see the small string that is at the top of his head. Cutting it will release his control. He will thank them and leave. He will not give them a discount. Unless they plead. 

### Arklow:

There are reports in the town of human bodies being mauled to death and others disappearing. They see a few drawings of the missing people, they notice one of them is [[DogUser1]]. 

In the night in the city, they see a person wearing a hood acting like a dog, but smarter attack them. This is the copy of [[Hearta]], she has the ability to copy them. She will run away. 


Girl has power to turn people into a thing she labels them, [[Novala]] can right now do 1 person. It can be herself or another person. It can be 2 adjectives and 1 noun. She does not have much of an imagination and turns people into dogs. Either loyal guard dog, loyal man-eating dog, etc. 

[[Hearta]] can copy an ability of another person, she can use that ability for 3 rounds. She has a [[Shrouding Ring]] and is from [[Abaddon's Armor]]. The extremist group. She has the ![[Mirror of Narcissus]]

# Summary


## Nain to forest 

[[Freja]] tells them to ask Bardi why he wanted to kill Varks. (Because he was investigating the shade trade)

After sending [[Bardi]] to [[Torg]], They are told to continue on to [[Hoste]]. 

The people of Nain seem to be confused as they heard several explosions coming from the castle, they can choose to explain or not. 

It is a 2 day journey to Erna. In the middle they will find a very small town of Tors, it is so small its not even on most maps.

**Day 1:**

They see bandits attacking a carriage, shifting through it to see if it has any goods. There are 5 of them, all have [[Shrouding Ring]]s. 2 of them special abilities, one of them has a [[Trow]] and the other has an [[Artifact]]. The Trow can turn themself into a wolf, ==howl Ulfr==. The artifact is:

![[Chain of Unfortunate Events]]

Out of session explain what an artifact is as [[Michael Leech]], [[Curze]], and [[Adamzka]] already know. [[Derick]] seems to be drawn in by it. 

The traders thank them and go on their way, saying it is the second time they got stolen from in such a short trip. The first was by Tors where a guy stole a learn to read book. 


Past lunch they find a caravan transporting items to [[Torg]]. They ask if they want anything, the trader notices that they are all [[Users]] because of his monocle, an artifact: 

![[Crystal Lens]]
 He says the path has been weird, specifically after Tors. 

If they ask, he is trying to get rid of a lot of his stalk because of all of the thieves in these roads. He already got stolen from near Tors. He says that he was lucky that person was stupid, he only took a useless [[Artifact]]:

![[Silent Veil]]
He asks them to look around the shop. They only find 3 that catch their eye(I am not making more):

![[Master Key]]
1000 g
![[Awfully Cumbersome]]
750 g
![[Reminisce]]
2000 g

He shows them a pair of invisible trousers called the Emperor's New Clothes saying that they can only be seen by the righteous, but that is actually true. [[Bobby]] notices something off about the trousers, if he puts them near his deck of cards, they turn into the Emperor card. He askes for 500 g to buy it. 

Derick is having a field day in here, it seems he has a sort of connection to these items, though he cannot place it. He is just happy to see all of them. 

He has an item that teleports people outside of his carriage and stuns them for half a day. 

## In the small town of Tors 

They reach here by nightfall. It is very small and rural, mostly covered in farmlands near the river and forests to all the other directions. There is a nice inn where a lot of the villagers are drinking and dancing. A cheap night, 1 silver for all 6 of the guys. At night Derick sees something in the distance and askes them to go with him. On top of a nearby hill there is a [[Trow]] sitting by himself. Derick realizes that it is his [[Spirits]]. He absorbs it, but does not know what it does. They can try and figure it out. He has 1 turn of it to start. 

==To absorb it, he must entertain it/make it bond with him in some way==

[[Derick]] has the power to maintain the affect of any [[Artifact]] he examines. Though he also has the downsides. His full, there are no downsides. As he examined the [[Chain of Unfortunate Events]], [[Crystal Lens]], [[Silent Veil]], and [[Reminisce]]. All of the effects apply to him in semi. Which means he has disadvantage, headaches, cannot speak, and hears voices, but is able to easily examine artifacts, and cut into memories. He has not yet learned to disable his power. His power is called ==Steal Amon==. 

In the morning, if they talk to the villagers, they say that they have heard people are getting stolen from, but not from there village so most of them pay it no mind thinking it is just some lucky kid that found some weapon or his spirit and is testing it out. Another says to talk to old lady Gertrude because her grandson was missing for a bit. She is by the tree near the center of the village. She tells them that he said he heard sounds from the forest and left. 2 days later she got a letter from him saying he found his spirit and is going to follow in the footsteps of [[Aegir]]. Except he could not write before. 


## Fight with [[Nibkil]] 

In the forest in the South it seems peaceful till bullets start to strike the wheels. They hear someone in the forest say to let him look at their stock and they can go peacefully. 

The birds do not seem to be scared of the gunshots. 

He has the ![[Silent Veil]]
and the ![[Sparrow's Song]]

This and a regular magic item which lets him teleport with another thing wearing that ring along with amazing sharpshooting, makes him a big threat. They cannot rely on luck to find him, and this is before he activates his ability of ==Strike Thor== to control electricity with his bullets. 

## From Tors to Erna 

They pass a guy going the same direction as them who askes if they got robbed too. He then gives them a word of advice, there is a ship docked a bit inland in Holl, be careful around there as it is possibly and [[Elvagars]]. He asks if he could have some food. He says that he saw another man rushing a bit ahead, around a half-a-days journey. He tells them that the elvagars may have done something to the path as he says some things are not correct on the path. 

Further on they start to hear music from up ahead. There are war drums beating. It seems to be a military march with an accompanying song. They were young for this, but they remember that it was the national anthem of the nation of Jakt. This used to be the border of their land and it seems the military march, made up of only 10 people are trying to stirrup some trouble. Asking for outdated ids and so on. Some of the soldiers seem ashamed to be doing this. They will let them go after a bit more blabbering, or in combat the old fat commander will try to summon a spirit which will not work. 

They see a dog barking at a tree next to a tree with a squirrel. Then a man hitting the ground around a bush, he says his master is out hunting, he needs to flush out the birds. Later on they see what looks like copper coins growing around a tree. They see a man hanging by the limb of a tree waving hello and welcoming them to Erna. 


## In Erna 

There are people talking about how cats and dogs fell out of the sky a few days ago. 

This is a bigger town with paved roads. The people say that they have seen [[Semos Varks]] here. He has been in the mayor's office trying to convince him of something. 

All the people of the town seem to like him. Knowing that the party might be after him, some thugs with [[Shrouding Ring]]s try to stop them. There is a man with a [[Nixie]] that makes people hate him, all of the group is forced to target him. 

There are a few paper boys that are throwing anti government posters. They say that the government takes the crops of the farmers and does not pay a fair price. their crops are worth twice as much. Sell to the Jakt merchants to get what you deserve. 

## Confrontation with Varks 

Inside the mayor's office, Varks is trying to get the mayor to rejoin the old Torg territory and give some land to him along the way. After seeing them, he decides to flee. 

He was talking to the mayor about reforming the old nations. He says that a unified nation cannot do anything in times of peace aside from kill its own people. He reveals that [[Freja]] was only 8 when she was taken. Her spirit needed the sacrifice of hundreds. We are at a stalemate and [[Kyling]] is not willing to give anything up. When the [[Elvagars]] attack, they are used to fighting unified governments, having several smaller groups will be much easier to slow down their progress. 

There are people that want to side with the elvagars, they will be quelled if smaller governments are made. Erna is the closest to becoming a City, in a matter of years it could be called the City of Progress. It is important the mayor sides with Torg, Thrall is already thinking of joining, 

If the party tries to jump him, he will call out his spirit and yell stop, ==charm Sancus==. This will make the players stop whatever they are doing for one turn, he will cut the closest with a dagger ![[Loose End]]
He will jump out of a window and yell a name, [[Gimhle]], and hold onto a thread and swing. 

The chase is through the city, 

There seems to be a puppet he is holding that is speaking, it lets people cast through it. Gimhle, the idiom guy is casting through it. To make them stop chasing, he can do a few things:

- On cloud nine - sends them 100 feet up
- Bite the bullet - if they try to shoot him
- in hot water - throws burning water on them 
- penny for your thoughts - pays them a copper to read their mind 
- Break a leg 
- Bite your tongue 
- Spill the beans - tidal wave of beans 
- Spill the Tea 
- Hold your horse 
- Hit the sack 
- bull in a china shop

#Speech/Debate 

Hello everyone, my name is Indraneel Kasuba and I am the president of debate. I want to thank all of you for coming to parent night. While your guardians are learning about the responsibilities they have being a part of this activity, y'all will be learning about who is in this team. First I am going to explain the den system, and how some of you might get to pie Michaels and me in the face. Then we will have some activities where you will get to know the people in your den. 

Whether you consider yourself lucky or unlucky, this is the first year we are doing the den system, so things may change in the future but for now, Here is the system:
There are 4 dens: Labrador, Alaskan, River, and Siberian. Each of them are split between novice and advanced debaters, around 4 advanced and 12-14 novices. In these there are mentors and mentees, these are advanced debaters assigned to you novices to help you with any questions you may have. 

Then there is the competition, this has the same scoring as the school spirit competition, the best team gets 4 points, the worst 1, whoever has the highest points will be the winner. There are 3 categories where y'all can win points: Spirit, Fundraising, and Debate. 

The spirit competition goes from now till the start of October. During this month there will be a few challenges to show your spirit with your den, whoever does the best in these challenges will get the 4 points for the spirit category. They will also get a prize. We will only be revealing the prize for spirit and overall today, as I have said before. Some of you will get to pie a few of the leadership in the face, that is the price for the overall. The prize for the spirit category on the other hand are free hoodies with your den logo on them in time for you to wear during our home tournament. 

Now that know know how all that works, its time for you to get to know your dens: {direct all of the dens into their corners}

For teambuilding we have 2 activities set up, first you may see a few pieces of paper on your desks, take one of them and design a den logo you would like to have on your hoodies, this is not for spirit points but I think you all can tell it is pretty important. The other activity is for spirit points, we are going to have a debate tournament.

It will be den vs den, we will have 5 minutes to research the topic, 5 minute first speech, then 2 minute cx, and finally 3 minute rebuttal speech. So team 1 speaks, team 2 cx, team 2 speak, team 1 cx, team 2 rebuttal, and finally team 1 rebuttal. In total, one round will take 25 minutes, we will have a losers bracket too, so in total this should take around an hour and 40 minutes. The winner will get a spirit point. Here are the debates:

The first is Alaskan vs Labrador, then River vs Siberian, then we will have the loser's cup, and finally we will have the finals between the 2 winners. Each debate will have different topics, the people not debating will be the judges, also working on their logo. Flip a coin to pick if they want to go aff or neg on the topic.

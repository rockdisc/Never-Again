Decreasing means the [[Slope]] is negative, increasing it slope is positive. 
[[Concavity]] is the change in rate of change. 

To determine if [[Functions]] are even or odd, replace the $x$ term with $-x$. If all of the signs are flipped, it is odd, if none are, it is even. Anything else it is neither. Even functions on a graph go the same way at their [[Limit]]. 

Know how [[Finding Roots]] of [[Polynomials]], this includes using the calculator and [[Synthetic Division]]. It may even need the [[Quadratic Formula]]. 

When given the degree and zeros of a polynomial, along with its y-intercept, you can find the slope by plugging 0 into all the x and the intercept for y, then solve. After you can get the standard form by solving for it. 

![[Rational Function]] 

Transformations are horizontal first, then vertical, going in order of [[PEMDAS]]. Everything inside of the paratheses of x is flipped. It is Dilation, Reflection, and Transformation. 

Let $h(x)=-2f(x+3)$, what is $h(3)$ is solved by first making $(3+3)$, then looking in the table for 6, getting that value to make $-2 \cdot 5$ if 6 corresponded to 5. 

in [[Domain]] transformations, when given a graph, plot points on one of those tables and then change the x and y above to get the values, when given just the Inequalities, put them inside. The [[Domain]] should be only inside the x parentheses, MAKE SURE TO FLIP EVERYTHING, the [[Range]] is only the y stuff. 

if there is a reflection or dilation, separate it, ONLY THE THING THAT IS INSIDE THE SMALLER PARENTHESES IS FLIPPED. 

just know [[Pascal's Triangle]] or memorize the rules, its not that deep. the n decreases on one term while increasing on another to get the value in the end 

put the table in the calc. add the little arrow on top, regression that is negative is an overestimate.

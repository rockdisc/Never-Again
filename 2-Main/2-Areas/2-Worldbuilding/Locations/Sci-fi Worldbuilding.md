#Worldbuilding/Consept #Rough 

These are just a few ideas I had for worldbuilding sci-fi over the years. It will most likely always stay in rough and the ideas may be used in different worlds, but it is good to have them all written and not be [[Fuzzy Ideas]]. 

The main settlements are within spheres that contain air. These structures have been there for so long that they have developed a religion. They are self sustaining but only at they size they are at. Any bigger and they would not hold together for some reason. They are still very big, around the size of a state. Though each of them fits around a billion people, so they are packed. Some people go on pilgrimages to the edges to clean it. These are mainly the middle class. 

The class divisions are coincidentally how the structure is made. The high class has access to direct sunlight and puts themself on what they call the canopy, they get access to private tutoring where they can teach their kids whatever they and are not forced to go to school. The main one, called the Tropic, is on the main pillar. This is where the government stays and runs. 

The government itself is an [[Oligarchy]] of the richest people. It is the richest man who becomes prime minister, though in the sphere there are only a few. So they rotate between themselves every year.

The middle class has some peripheral access to the sun, if they want it. Aside from that they are the main class for higher end jobs. They are what keeps things running, and are the heaviest controlled. The schooling is just a way of churning out more workers and teaches them fake history to make them stay where they are in the social standings. They are sold religions of the sphere and think of the center and edges as holy places. 

The lower class has no access to sunlight, where it would are the air cleaners. There are a lot of people that live near the edges so that is no holy ground to them. Instead it is the center. 

The religion of the one building was not made by the orgs, but instead rose from the desperation of the people. They believe at the start there was one building, and now we will come back to one building. This can be expanded on more but the main jest is that each floor is on both sides, it is a sphere because there is an underground they are hiding and as above so below. 

As it is an enclosed sphere, there is no rain. The protagonist could be from modern times and have more information than the other people and grow, while in a middle or upper class shower(made to mimic rain), he could say "I miss the rain."

# Ley Line

There are 2 ley lines in the [[Material World]]. These lines spin along their specific axes, More specific information down below. These ley lines are actually connections to the other worlds, and are points that cross over into the material world. People bore on these lines gain a special power and the ability to see [[Magic Explained#Physics|Vibra]]. Being born on a line gives you a [[Curse]]. They both have 2 [[Node]]s which are where they are constant. They both rotate at the same speed, exactly 1° per day, making a complete cycle in 360 days(a year). Around 113 km/day, the [[Circumference]] is 40,680 km. Due to the world also rotating, the [[Ecliptic]] line is the most common for people to be born under as it rotates on almost the same axis the rotation of the world is on. It goes through every spot in the world, with a few repeating due to the seasons. The lines overlap during the [[Equinox|vernal and autumnal equinoxes]]. There are also 2 points of intersections, which are called the [[Haunt]]s.

## Ecliptic Line:
Rotates on the ecliptic and has its nodes on the North and South [[Mana Pole]]s, which are different from the magnetic poles and are exactly 90° from the ecliptic so it spins exactly in 1 cardinal direction. 

It is believed to give powers that effect ones surroundings, this being mind. It is considered the power of the [[Blue Moon]].
## [[Declination]] Line:
Rotates on the line of declination and has its nodes on 2 points in random spots on the equator. On the equinoxes it points 90° from the [[Red Moon]]
 
It is believed to give powers that effect oneself, relating to the spirit. It is considered the power of the [[Green Moon]].

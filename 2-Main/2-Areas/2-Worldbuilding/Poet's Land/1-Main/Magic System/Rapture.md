# Rapture

When an [[Ikon]] ascends to [[Ikon|godhood]], they gain the ability to give others their [[Bind]]s. This allows for the gods to control those people to do want even they tell them to do. When a god is being devoured, they can make all of their bind holders commit ritual suicide to regain their powers. This is a rapture. All of the gods have told their believers of the end days to make sure that they can get a stable mind and be stabilized by the prayers after they come back. 
They will most often than not kill themselves using their own power, people that believe in a god of the heath and have small amounts of fire control will burn themselves alive. Others that do not have combative powers will do things like pile together in a hill of bodies to make it act like a single point for the god to make it easier for them to be absorbed.

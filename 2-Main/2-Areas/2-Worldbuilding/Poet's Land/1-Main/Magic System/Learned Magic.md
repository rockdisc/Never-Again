## Circles

Magic comes from the [[Ley Line]]s to people born, but it can also come from the [[Magic Explained#How it relates to the world|Vibra]]. People, through trial and error figured out a way of coding information to create spells. Though yes, it is theoretically possible for regular people to create spells, it is like being a blind watchmaker, almost impossible. Once a spell is written it can be used by anyone, not just the person that created it. Though yes, only the most commonly used and simplest spells can be written down, there are a few that generations spent to create. They also have the effect that if one were to try and create one and messes up, it could lead to their death. For all of these reasons, mainly due to profiteering, the spells are kept secret, the idea of spells themselves are hidden to the regular people.  Though there are some that have gone to the [[Public Domain]] as either they have been leaked or the lineage died out. Though just because they are public does not mean they are free, as there is a large demand for it, and everyone that has it can make money from it. Though there are a few that are so popular that they are free / everyone knows them.

### Spellcrafting

There are only a few mages that actively create spells as it is gruelingly hard and tedious work. As explained in [[Magic Explained#Physics|here]], There are a few ratios that are absurd. It also requires a lot of stamina to test and debug these spells. If one does not have the ability to protect oneself, it will be much more dangerous to do this. 

As always, when there is a niche formed around creating something, there are people that make tools for those creators. There are several spellcrafter starter kits that can be bought and other free tools that can be found if one knows were to look.

## Alchemy

It is a process of creating potions and enchanting/creating items by using circles and [[Gift]]s. It is based on the real world way of Alchemy. People do not know how exactly magic potions work, all they know is they type of element in each plant. Like in this diagram:

[[Transmigrators]] may be confused when first learning about this, but if they are smart, they can realize that it is just the name of the world in the language they are speaking, their brain translated it into Earth.

By using metals and compounds to push the edge of the elements, they can get specific effects. The real magic comes in when specific magical plants of specific [[Numen|elves]] are used because they can ask for small scale gifts, which the elves seem to grant with just a small sacrifice leading to the a bit of the power of the plant being imbued into the potion. Though this is also a task that takes a lot of diligence as just one drop of another substance can lead to dilution of the potion. A few even use [[Epitome]]s and work through trial and error

### Enchanting

About the same thing as Alchemy, but used on weapons and other objects to give them magical powers. While alchemy barely uses epitomes, enchanting depends on it because most use the [[Epitome#Epitome Fusion|property of epitome fusion]] to make the items use and accept the powers. They need specific way of making them to do this, putting an epitome in a weapon or item during a spot where it is disassembled. For blades it could be when it is being foraged and for items that come together, it can be crushed into a power and spread between the parts as glue before they come together.

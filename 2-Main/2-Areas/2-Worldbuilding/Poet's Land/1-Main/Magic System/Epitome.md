# Epitome

It is the thing that holds the power of an [[Ikon]], [[Ikon|God]], and [[Blights]] of the [[Blue Moon]], as well as [[Numen]], [[Numen|Elves]], and [[Blights]] of the [[Green Moon]].
It lies inside the malformity of the [[Curse]]. It resembles a small black orb that seems to suck in light. Kind of like a [[Bind]] as binds are just a part of a uniqueness that is on top of the skin and spread out to be able to get back to the god. When the epitome is spread out, like if a god has multiple people with binds or an elf has an entire forest to itself, the epitome is useless if it is spread out, in which case they need to come together to make a true epitome. This is the reason in which [[Rapture]]s people all come together and die. 
People that are not born on the lines have an epitome, which is just their mind and soul.
### Epitome Fusion

When 2 epitomes, or 2 semi epitomes are near each other, they will want to fuse. That is why an epitome is created when a forest of the same plant is wiped out they come together to create an epitome.
They also attract due to this. The attraction is stronger the stronger the person is. It is not only to the same leave, but weaker people also get pulled by fate (aka the [[Author]]) in that direction.

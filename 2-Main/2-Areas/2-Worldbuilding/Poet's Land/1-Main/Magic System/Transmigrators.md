They are people that come from the [[Garden of Eden(Poet's Land)]] to the [[Material World]]. These two worlds are interlinked as the [[Ikon|God]]s and [[Numen|Elves]] are in this world and [[Demon(Poet's Land)|Demon]]s and [[The Forgotten]] are in the other. When a person dies in one world, they are sent to the other. Memories are not erased, but as most people die before they make memories or damage their brain when they die(brain death), their memories get wiped. This does not apply to people born on the [[Ley Line]]s of Earth or their equivalent. When they die, no matter how, they will maintain their memories and will be in the body with the same age as they died. They will be in the body of a [[Curse]]d. 

## Latecomers 

People that are transmigrated and maintain their memories are called latecomers, it seems most people die at birth on Earth if they are born on their magical places. They combine beings with a cursed and become the same person. They are welcomed into two main churches, [[Church of the Nameless God]] accepts people in [[Witlan]] and other generic Western areas and [[Church of the Venerable Dynast]] in [[The Land of Countless Rivers]] and surrounding areas. 

There are also smaller organizations which are funded by these churches but do not work directly under them if they do not want to join there religion. The one important to the story is the one in [[Presford]] called the [[London Fan Club]].

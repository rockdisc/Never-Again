Used to contact [[Numen|Elves]] in the [[Spirit World]] to most often ask for information, [[Learned Magic#Alchemy|Alchemy]], or [[Gift]]s. 
This is the procedure to do a regular ritual:

Create a fire
burn 3 plants that are common and local in your area
burn 3 that are not local to your area
burn a magical plant
chant "**O ye who dwell where limbs and spirits meet,**  
In thickets deep where none but ghosts dare tread,  
From womb of wood, whose roots run deep through death,  
But ever grows where living things have bled—

O root-born lords, thou ever-greening race,  
Whose limbs beget the blossom and the briar,  
Look now with favor on this barren place,  
And spark in soil thy soul’s most sacred flame."

Burn the plant of the elf you are trying to talk to
Burn whatever you want to sacrifice

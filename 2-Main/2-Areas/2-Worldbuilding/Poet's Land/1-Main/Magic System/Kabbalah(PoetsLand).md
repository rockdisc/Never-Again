This is an organization later created by [[Gyles]] as a way to collect [[Ikon#Dragon|Dragon]]s and [[Numen#Giant|Giant]]s to ascend. It is based on the structure of the [[Kabbalah]] with each of the sephirah being a person or concept.

Keter is not taken by anyone as it is something of a true god, which all of them want to be, it would be weird if one were to call themself that.

| Chokmah           | [[Gyles]]       | He is the Three-Legged-Bird, the Owl chosen by the Mother Crow.

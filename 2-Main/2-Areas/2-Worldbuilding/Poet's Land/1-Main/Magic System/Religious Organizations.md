# Religious Organizations

Religions are organized to give believers to [[Ikon]]s who are trying to ascend to gods. As the people higher in the ranks are given [[Bind]]s, and the stronger the god gets the more people the god needs. It is natural that they have also created organized to protect its believers and gains power itself by using the [[Epitome]]s with the [[Blights]] they kill. 

There are other [[Small Magical Organization]]s, which includes cults which are just the organizations that worship smaller gods. The organizations can have good or bad relationships with some of the smaller churches, but the [[Great Goddesses]] are fine with most small organizations, even offering some resources.

As they are all major Organizations who have been working with each other for dozens of years, they have the same organization structure:
Lowest to Highest

Recruit
Member
Head
Ancient
Commander
Deacon
Archdeacon (From this point addressed as venerable)
_From this point it is mainly bind users as it is hard for an ikon to get this strong without turning into [[Ikon]]s_
Bishop 1%
Archbishop 2.5%
Cardinal 5%
Pope 10%

| [[Church of the Scarlet Goddess]]  | Hegwinons | [[Red Moon]]   | [[Church of the Scarlet Goddess\|Imperial Watchers]]    | Strick rule over observing all magical events of the city. They will gain all the information about an area before acting, this also makes the other organizations make jokes about how they are late to everything. They also act as the main detectives and judiciary branch of the underground working closely with the governments of the areas they are located. They have the Imperial Library which all major organizations use to gain information. |
| [[Church of the Azure Goddess]]    | Udrons    | [[Blue Moon]]  | [[Church of the Azure Goddess\|Minutemen]]              | As fast acting as the tides, they have been trained to respond instantly to whatever they hear and figure it out later. They are so famous that the common people also know who they are but do not know that they have magical abilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Church of the Jade Goddess]]     | Wahions   | [[Green Moon]] | [[Church of the Jade Goddess\|Emerald Templar]]         | Very orderly and strict. Mainly used as a guard detail for the higher classes of people. They have what they call [[Emerald Templar\|the ground]] where they train, and offer to other organizations to use, the [[Minutemen]] have their own section for how often they use it, though they are most often in and out.                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Church of the Crowned Son]]      | Heliates  | Sun            | [[Church of the Crowned Son\|Solar Inquisitors]]        | They are the lawyers of the underground world, they truly believe that their word is correct, as most of their beliefs are the same as everyone else, it almost seems that the other holy texts just add from the heliate texts. Their younger members are most often found in the imperial library studying older cases.                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Church of the Telluric Mother]]  | Gelates   | Earth & Sea    | [[Church of the Telluric Mother\|Godsworn]]             | Are not in many cities, but in the ones they are in they have eyes in all of the land and sea trade routes. Their religion is mercantile and they stop stealing and piracy in the seas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Church of the Venerable Dynast]] | Ramites   | Sky            | [[Church of the Venerable Dynast\|Thousand-High Guard]] | As the names states, there are only a thousand of them. The problem with that is that each of them as .1% of their god's power which is enough to call them all venerable as they have other abilities on top of that, they are only employed in the worst cases.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Church of the Nameless God]]     | Yehwens   | Great Creator  | [[Church of the Nameless God\|Paladin Cores]]           | Are the seal teams of the underground world. They are very well trained even if they do not have that strong of powers, they are mainly used in military missions or other high ranking missions as they work very closely with the Thousand-High Guard.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

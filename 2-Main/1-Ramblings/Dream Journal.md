#Writing #Report 

Just to keep track of some cool dreams I had and if they could be used in my writings. 

A was a military cadet training with a small group of people and an instructor. Though there were concrete floors, there was a gray cloudy ceiling and all the buildings were like log cabins with the windows green. The mess hall had a shop stand that sold notebooks and the pencils with decorative erasers. 
I think it was symbolic of campiness in my brain.

I was in a debate round, but the judge stopped us and told us about the things that live in the sky. Within the clouds there are cities of stones made of moving brick and creatures that wriggle and worm. He told us to implement it into our plan like a [[Specification]].
I do not know what this means.

#Writing/Mini-Essay 

I am scared of things falling apart in front of me. I think I have gotten used to and sort of come to the understanding that nothing will last, it is still my first reaction to think of ways of "fixing" it or at least try to, but it will eventually happen. What I am still scared of though, is that of things falling apart while I am using them. I do not want to lose thing, or people. I think that is universal. These notes for example were backed up several times before, even with accidentally wiping my hard drive, they still remained. That is because of all the effort I went through to keep it that way. Though I do not have that now. If this laptop were to get nuked again, I would lose all of my notes, and that scares me, more than losing the laptop. A monetary lose can be recovered from, I can always make more money, no matter how long it takes, but I cannot write everything again word for word. That is something that disappears, ideas. Though I want to get used to that as well. I want to make an impact on the world, whether that be through [[Internet Archaeologists]] finding my notes in the future. I want to do something, though I feel keeping everything I have written for storage for however long it would take would not be the best way to do it. It is a start now with keeping all of my notes on this, lets hope it is worth it.

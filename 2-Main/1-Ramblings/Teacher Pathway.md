## Sequence 9: Teacher
New abilities:
- **Orating/Presenting**. Allows for a **Teacher** to get every word that they want to get out, out. By speaking, the listener will want to hear every word that is being said and will understand even the most confusing concepts.
	- A **Teacher** can inherently find the best way to explain the topic to their student by somewhat accessing their spirit/knowledge body to get a better understanding of the person. 
- **Learning**. It can work on others and oneself. Through enhanced pattern recognition and better knowledge accumulation, a **Teacher** is able to identify new concepts or create connections leading to new discoveries or better hypotheses. 
	- They have much better memory, though not perfect, they can remember all of the information in a lecture and how it was presented. They can also remember how the students were feeling 
	- Their pattern recognition is better and they have an easier time not been tricked by false results in pattern recognition 

## Sequence 8: Writer
New Abilities:
- **Working Memory**. They can think of a whiteboard or piece of paper in their head and it will act as such. They are able to write and put memory pictures or do whatever they want, and it will stay. 
- **Lingering Knowledge**. Even after the things the **writer** has written as been erased or torn up and burned, the knowledge will linger, when a person picks up the paper or the ashes of it, they will know something was written there. The better preserved, the more the message can be understood 

Strengthened Abilities: 
- Their memory has drastically improved and they are now able to remember entire books in their head word for word 
- **Orating** can be used in written form and it more convincing 
- Writing will give major benefits to **Learning** allowing it to be much faster, even if they write in their **Working Memory**. 
## Sequence 7: Mimic 
New Abilities:
- **Mimicry**. The **Mimic** is able to perfectly copy the speech, handwriting, and even thought patterns of the person they got a piece of rhetoric from. Whether it be a speech or letter, as long at it has a decent amount of information, they can mimic them. 
- **Mirroring**. If the person being copied by the **mimic** is seen by them, or they start mimicking in front of them, the person will start to mirror their action. 

Strengthened Abilities:
- All previous abilities get enhanced, longer **Lingering Knowledge**, bigger **Working Memory**, etc. 

## Sequence 6: Inscriber 
New Abilities:

- **Living Text**. Text will change to languages that can be understood by a **Inscriber** and arrange themselves to be as clear as possible.
	- They can change them to do the opposite but the information itself has to stay the same 

Strengthened Abilities:
- **Orating** will now make the people listening not want to look away

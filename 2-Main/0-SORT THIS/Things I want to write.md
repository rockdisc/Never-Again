Institutionalized 

A fantasy story about breaking institutional barriers 

A story of a god moving around, think Kino's Travels, this god can be one that used to be worshiped a lot in the past, but now does not have a following. The man in the woods open. 

The cyberpunk setting, maybe make this institonalized 

The story with vinnettes I am writing right now

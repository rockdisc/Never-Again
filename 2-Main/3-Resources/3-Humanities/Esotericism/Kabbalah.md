## Sefirot
Each sefirot(sphere) has their own meaning along with each path.

1. Keter, Crown: Divine will and urge to create, from the Ein Sof the infinite source where the Jewish god was born from or before he developed a sense of self. Something beyond human understanding. 
2. Chokhmah, Wisdom: Wisdom from nothing, [[Ex Nihilo]]. The first power of conscious intellect, also called Sophia 
3. Binah, Intelligence: Understanding or contemplation, it is likened to a palace of mirrors which reflect and mold Chokhmah
4. Hesed, Mercy: Kindness and love show help that goes above and beyond what anyone would normally do.
5. Gevurah, Judgement/Strength: it also includes limitation
6. Tiferet, Beauty: includes spirituality and miracles
7. Netsah, Endurance/Eternity/Victory: Leadership and rally others to act
8. Hod, Majesty: the balance between the emotions and intelligence, being able to have strength and majesty while being able to submit.
9. Yesod, Foundation: It is what connects the sefirot above to the world down below, it is the power of connection and prayer
10. Malkuth, Kingdom: It is the physical world, it is the un-spritual

There is also Da'at which is the center where all 10 Sefirot are combined into 1. 

## Origins 

The world was created in the process of Tzimtzum, a wiggle of Ein Sof, as it shifted or stretched in and out, the world was created. From there everything came to be. 

## Symbolism 
There is said to be 4 worlds in a descending chain of existence: emanation, creation, formation, and action. Below those is the fifth world, the material. They are the process of origin, or creation. 

Man is said to create and provide harmony into existence as they have a connection to the divine. He has 5 parts of his soul, the animal part for carvings, the spirit for morality,

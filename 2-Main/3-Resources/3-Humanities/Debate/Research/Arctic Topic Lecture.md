#Speech/Debate/Research 

##### Resolved: The United States Federal Government should significantly increase its exploration and/or development of the Artic.

# Overview of Artic

Named after the constellation [[Ursa Major]]

## Geographically 

Land, sea, and Ice 66.5$\degree$ North, or above the [[Arctic Circle]].

![[Arctic Circle]]

## Geopolitically 

The Artic States are:
Russia, Canada, Denmark(Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the US(Alaska). This can raise issues for things like the Artic Council because of the amount of land each owns. 50% is Russian.

## Climatically 

Daily [[Heat and Temperature|temp]] does not exceed 10$\celsius$. 
This definition means that the artic is shrinking with climate change, I could see some [[Topicality|T]]s that say that the plan does not cover the climatic artic, or [[Affirmative|Aff]]s that it does not apply because that is not part of the artic anymore. 

## Artic Exceptionalism 

This can be used to say there will be no conflicts in the Artic, as it has not happened before. 

## Artic Council 

Cute fox. 8 states, 6 permanent participants(native groups), working groups, and 38 observers. 

The participants are the AIA, ICC, AAC, Saami, GCI, and RAIPON. ICC is the most active. 

Kenneth Hoegh is the chair. Norway used to be leader, now handed off to Denmark. 

[[UNCLOS]] applies in this sea, there could be plans that are just making the US sign it. 

There is an agreement for scientific collaboration between the nations, will have to see if this includes the participants, if not it will be a major [[Kritik|K]] opportunity. 

## Indigenous Peoples of the Artic 

![[Final+linguistics+map.webp|700]]

3-1 ratio between settlers and indigenous peoples

## Climate Change 

It is increasing 2-4 times faster than the rest of the world. A positive feedback loop as the dark ocean absorbs the heat which then makes it hotter creating more dark ocean. 2050 means there will be no ice in Artic summers. That would increase the sea level by 7-meters, so perfect everyone dies argument. Trump stopped the program to monitor this. Carbon sink is back, yippee. Methane Hydrates can release more [[Greenhouse Gasses]].

Good news is more sea routes. One big one that would be available is the transpolar sea route which goes straight through the center.

Sea ice is at the lowest ever. Ocean circulation is struggling. US seems to stop caring about this as all 400 scientists working on it were fired. 

There is about 50% of the world's oil in the Artic and a lot of gas. There is not a lot of renewable energy. REMs are everywhere there. 

Greenland basically has Denmark as its sugar daddy. In independent indigenous governance, it wants to slowly get independence. This could be an avenue, like make the US support and aid Greenland which leads to world peace or something. 

# US Artic Policy (Trump)

## Alaska
Loser thought to be a waste of money turns out to have OVERPOWERED powers and be SUPER rich - basically Alaska 

There were several polices, Research and policy act, Order 66, Nat Strategy for Artic.

They want presence there for 3 main reasons:
Security 
Environment
Econ 

There are a lot of different agents, I don't think [[ASPEC]] will work. Though Trump is diminishing their powers. 

Alaska has military in it 

## Freeland 

I still cannot believe Trump wants to buy Greenland. 

He wants it for the REMs and having a bigger presence in the Artic. Shocker Greenland does not want to join. 

The US only has 2 icebreakers, China has 4 and is planning to build more, and Russia has 41. A bit behind not going to lie. Both are very old, Healy might have dementia. The US is planning to build 8.

Trump put tariffs on the Artic, but they are on pause. There were random nations that do not even trade with the US on the list(AI?)

Trump is allowing drilling in the [[ANWR]](Artic National Wildlife Refuge).

# Args on the Topic 

## Aff
### Security

Creating new icebreakers, ports, bases, satellites, launch platforms 
Buy Greenland 
Increase coop or monitoring


### Climate/Resources 

Oil, gas, REM, seed bank, geoengineering(make clouds more white), renewables, cleanup, and monitoring

### Indigenous

Research, languages, and policymaking 


## DA

Russia & China, Politics, environment, resources, tradeoffs as always
Unilateral bad and hurts Artic Council or [[Nato]] 
Dip Cap, focusing on one area of the world is bad 
Soft power of US is bad or other country good 

## Kritik 

Security, think of a country as a threat, it will become one 
IR, International relations, Fem, and so on
Coloniality, Colonialism bad and leave it to the people
Cap, as always 

## CP 

Alaska only (states)
Make Canada do it 
Do it with others 
US should ask 
Private sector 

## T

Explore on ground or afar
physical?
dev econ?
Does "its" mean US can't contract out exploration and development?

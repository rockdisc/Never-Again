General:


I have individual notes for each team, most of these do not affect my ballot as they were not mentioned in round, but they still contain good advice you should take into the rest of your rounds. 

COACHES: even if you do not want the teams to know their record, you can show them the specific notes as all of my RFD is within this note.

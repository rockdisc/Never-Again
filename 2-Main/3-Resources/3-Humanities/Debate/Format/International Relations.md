[[Epistemology]] studies how we learn things and gain knowledge

[[Ontology]] is if things exist

This goes into indigenous knowledge, and whether it differs from what Western people know. 

Animals themselves can know things, and this can impact our plan if we do not have a big enough [[Impact]] 


# Theories of International Relations

> [!Important] Definitions 
> A state is a country. A nation is a group of people, there can be multiple nations inside of a state

The main idea is that the world is anarchic, there are no rules in international politics. 

States are rational actors, the problem is finding what rational they use

- Realism 
Security and power. The assumption is that the world is in a state of anarchy, there are no leaders but hegemons. Hegemons are who have power(in the sense of military strength), or hegemony. Real politic wants to have all the power. 

Every state in a state of anarchy, is rational, in their security, wants more power. That means they cannot be trusted by other countries. Which would mean conflict.  


- Liberalism 
The world is anarchistic, there is no leader, but power comes through economic power. They want to reduce anarchy. What can one state offer to the other, and so on. The US is a Liberal country in international politics. It takes the other option from the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]]. 


- Constructivism 
The world is anarchical, though that is made through people's perceptions. Just by calling people things or putting them into groups will make them that way. The way you see the world is the way that you construct it. 


The problem with indigenous peoples is that neither realists, liberals, or neoliberals want to trade with them on a greater scale, as one of them takes from them, the others will take their land and their goods and just give them money for it.

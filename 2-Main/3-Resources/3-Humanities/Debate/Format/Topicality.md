#Speech/Debate 

Topicality is a [[Negative]] strategy used to say that the [[Affirmative|Aff]]'s plan is not related to the [[Resolution]]. Here are the parts:

# Neg
## Interp 
This is the interpretation of the word. This is most often a [[Card]]. that says a definition that does not include the plan of the Aff. These can be as old as you want, though having it be too old can lead to arguments of the word not being used like that anymore. 

## Violation 
What the Aff violated in the ruling, like "they do not increase development by 10%". It is most often very small. 

## Standards 
This why the Neg's Interp is better, most common of the reasons are:
- Limits: It makes sure that there are not too many cases, allowing for prep for the neg to be possible. 
- Ground: It gives both sides a fair argument 
- Predictability: Plans should be able to be guessed from the resolution 
- Bright-line: Clear boundaries mean there is no need for judge intervention 
- Precision: having a precise topic allows for better debate
- Education: Having this interp allows for more education in the debate round 

## Voters 
Why the judge should vote for the neg:
- Fairness: Giving the neg this round means that in the future the aff will be discouraged to use the plan which will increase fairness in general. 
- Education: Only topical debates increase clash, which will increase education 

# Aff
There are several ways the aff can counter:
## We Meet 
Saying that in the interp of the neg, the aff is still topical 

## Counter Interp 
Give a counter you thing is better than their interpretation which also includes the plan 

## Standards 
Argue standards in your own counter interp, they are the same but the aff must say that either the ones they have are better or the ones the neg has: 
- Limits: It makes sure that there are not too many cases, allowing for prep for the neg to be possible. 
- Ground: It gives both sides a fair argument 
- Predictability: Plans should be able to be guessed from the resolution 
- Bright-line: Clear boundaries mean there is no need for judge intervention 
- Precision: having a precise topic allows for better debate
- Education: Having this interp allows for more education in the debate round 

## Voters 
Same as Neg, but the aff will that they do not hurt the voters but that they are on their side: 
- Fairness: Giving the neg this round means that in the future the aff will be discouraged to use the plan which will increase fairness in general. 
- Education: Only topical debates increase clash, which will increase education 
- Reasonability: Saying that the aff is reasonable enough to vote Aff even if Neg as a better Interp 

Education turn is very common with saying having a very direct aff creates better education.

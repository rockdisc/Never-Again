## Summary 

Written on Reddit, it is a horror story which is spread throughout unconnected posts. It says that [[LSD]] unlocks your brain to things like flesh interfaces. It is a bit too much to explain in these notes, I will just link a video with the audio. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwiDXrcn0N0 Good luck

## Interesting Points

Segmentation, where people are being cut, but they can still feel themselves. Kind of like in the [[Monument Mythos]].

People start to worship beings after being isolated and given LSD, this even leads them to make flesh interfaces. 

Ant farms are in areas with flesh interfaces, they mimic the paths of people going about their daily life. The more the path is travelled, the thicker the ant farm.

People going into hills like pregnant bellies 

People come out of flesh interfaces unborn, in wombs

A nice illusion of a grandma's house

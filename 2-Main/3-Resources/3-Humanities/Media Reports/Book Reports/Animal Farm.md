## Summary 

Written by George Orwell, it started as an allegory for Soviet Russian, but as it is in the format of a tale, it can be used for any government. It starts with animals in a farm that are fed up with the humans whipping them and not giving them food. Old Major, a pig, gives the animals ideas of freedom and rebellion to create a society where all animals are equal. After a night of no food, the animal do revolt and kick out the humans. The leaders of the animals are two pigs, Snowball, and Napoleon with his sidekick Squealer. They have 7 commandments. Kicking Snowball out, Napoleon becomes a dictator over the animals with Squealer spreading propaganda. He starts twisting the rules for the benefit of the pigs alone. It even gets to a point where he ships off one of the biggest characters to be killed. The animals go without food and in the end the pigs start walking on two feet with whips, they look the same as humans. 

## Interesting Points

Governments are like people. They are not ways good, they can make mistakes. When they make these mistakes, they will say the bed had no sheets. This book will help make it so that it will be harder to do, so that we are the donkey, not the sheep.

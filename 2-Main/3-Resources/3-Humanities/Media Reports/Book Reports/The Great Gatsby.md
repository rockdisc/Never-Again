# The Great Gatsby
#Report/Book #Ela/Classic

## Summary 

Set in the roaring 20s, Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate and World War I veteran, who moves to West Egg on Long Island and becomes neighbors with the mysterious and wealthy Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is known for throwing extravagant parties, but remains an enigma to his guests. As Nick gets drawn into Gatsby’s world, he learns that Gatsby’s wealth and lavish lifestyle are all part of a grand obsession: winning back his former lover, Daisy Buchanan, who is now married to the wealthy but arrogant Tom Buchanan. Through Nick, Gatsby reconnects with Daisy, reigniting a romance that ultimately unravels under the weight of lies, class divisions, and unattainable dreams.

The novel explores themes of illusion versus reality, the American Dream, and the moral decay beneath the glittering surface of wealth. Despite Gatsby’s idealism and relentless hope, his dream of re-creating the past with Daisy is doomed from the start. The tragic climax—marked by betrayal, a hit-and-run accident, and Gatsby’s lonely death—exposes the emptiness of the upper class and the fragility of aspirational dreams. In the end, *The Great Gatsby* paints a poignant portrait of a man destroyed by his own unrealistic visions, while also offering a critical commentary on the illusion of progress and success in America

## Interesting Points

The American dream is to go up in classes in society to get a better life for yourself in the big city. This book shows that it is not all that, people who find themselves at that level are not the best of heart. They have used tricks to get there and they will use it on you.

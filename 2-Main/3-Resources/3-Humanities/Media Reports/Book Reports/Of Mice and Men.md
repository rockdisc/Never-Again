#Ela/Classic/Modern #Report/Book

## Overview
Taking place in the great depression, of mice and men is about George, a small and smart man, and his large and mentally challenged friend Lennie, who he is protective of. Lennie likes to touch soft things though he cannot control his strength leading to him most often crushing them. In the book they are trying to get enough money and resources to make their own farm, though are unable to as they are in the [[Great Depression]]. On the farm they are currently working in, there is a man named Curley and he has a wife. 
At a point in the story Lennie gets a puppy, which he later ends up accidently killing, this makes him think that George will not let him take care of the bunnies at their future farm so he tries to hide it. While this is happening Curley's wife finds him and learns about the puppy, to cheer him up she allows him to pet her hair which is very fluffy, but he grabs it too strong and she screams, Lennie gets scared by this and panics, accidently killing her. The towns people later find out about this and create a mob to find him, though they think it is an accident, they, specifically George sends Curley the opposite direction of where Lennie ran too, and George goes to find Lennie. When he finds Lennie, Lennie starts to run away thinking he is mad at him, but George calms him down and talks about their future farm and shoots him:

>George had been listening to the distant sounds. For a moment he was business-like. "Look acrost the river, Lennie, an' I'll tell you so you can almost see it." Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the darkening slopes of the Gabilans. "We gonna get a little place," George began. He reached in his side pocket and brought out Carlson's Luger; he snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun lay on the ground behind Lennie's back. He looked at the back of Lennie's head, at the place where the spine and skull were joined. A man's voice called from up the river, and an-other man answered. "Go on," said Lennie. George raised the gun and his hands shook, and he dropped his hand to the ground again. "Go on," said Lennie. "How's it gonna be. We gonna get a little place." "We'll have a cow," said George. "An' we'll have maybe a pig an' chickens . . . . an' down the flat we'll have a . . . . little piece alfalfa- " "For the rabbits," Lennie shouted. "For the rabbits," George repeated. "And I get to tend the rabbits." "An' you get to tend the rabbits." Lennie giggled with happiness. "An' live on the fatta the lan'." "Yes." Lennie turned his head. "No, Lennie. Look down there acrost the river, like you can almost see the place." Lennie obeyed him. George looked down at the gun. There were crashing footsteps in the brush now. George turned and looked toward them. "Go on, George. When we gonna do it?" "Gonna do it soon." "Me an' you." "You . . . . an' me. Ever'body gonna be nice to you. Ain't gonna be no more trouble. Nobody gon-na hurt nobody nor steal from 'em." Lennie said, "I thought you was mad at me, George." "No," said George. "No, Lennie. I ain't mad. I never been mad, an' I ain't now. That's a thing I want ya to know." The voices came close now. George raised the gun and listened to the voices. Lennie begged, "Le's do it now. Le's get that place now." "Sure, right now. I gotta. We gotta." And George raised the gun and steadied it, and he brought the muzzle of it close to the back of Lennie's head. The hand shook violently, but his face set and his hand steadied. He pulled the trigger. The crash of the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down again. Lennie jarred, and then settled slowly forward to the sand, and he lay without quivering. George shivered and looked at the gun, and then he threw it from him, back up on the bank, near the pile of old ashes.

# Writing to Learn
#Report/Book 

## Summary 

This book is about learning with several portions of other books in it. This is because **all knowledge is interconnected, writing it the key to access it.** People designate writing to only be a field of its own, but that is not the case. It should be used in all fields. People will greatly benefit from writing inn all fields as writing helps a lot with learning. Writing is necessary for leaning, [[Fuzzy Ideas]] are bad and writing turns them solid. 
There are 2 [[Types of Writing]], type a is to write about existing ideas, while type b is to help create new ones. it is beneficial(specifically in a) to think before you write it down. 
Noise is useless information that pollutes the main idea, Jargon should be used lightly, **use smaller words**. Visuals should be given not just a person's senses, but also the experience of humanity in general. Active verbs make a place seem more alive.
Art and writing should teach how to look. No matter what is the medium, and give the info needed to understand the art. Art is seen through memories, so it must base itself on memories and hallucinations.
When introducing a new term, make sure to make the reader comfortable with it. 

To write about math you need to do 3 things: describe the problem, discuss the approach, and explain the findings. Writing about math helps us think about it more deeply.

Geologists are limited by time, astronomers are limited in distance, and ocean people are limited by depth. Yet we still find a way to learn. 

Even a small thing like turtles will take several people dedicating their entire lives to learn about. 
Old zoology experiments were hilarious, throwing lizards to see if they would come back to land.

Questions can cross subjects, these tie the subjects together and facilitate more learning. 

Math is a language like English, writing about math is like summarizing it.

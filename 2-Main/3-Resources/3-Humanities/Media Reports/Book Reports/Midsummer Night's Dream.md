## Summary 

Written by [[William Shakespeare]], it is a comedy that takes place during the wedding of [[The Odyssey|Odysseus]]. There is woman named Hermia who loves Lysander but has to marry Demetrius, and her friend Helena who is in love with Demetrius. They all decide to run into the forest. In the forest there is the fairy king and queen, Oberon and Titania, who got in a fight, so Oberon askes a fairy named Puck to get him a love potion to give to his wife to make her fall in love with a random animal as a prank. As Puck goes out to find this, we sees a trope of actors who are taking a trip through the forest and he makes one of their heads into a donkey's. This man then sleeps next to Titania, who is now under the love spell, when she wakes up she falls in love with the donkey-headed man. Oberon seeing the couples from before decides to fix it by making Demetrius fall in love with Helena, so he instructs Puck to give the love potion to the man. Puck mixes up the two men and gives it to Lysander. Oberon trying to fix the mistake, give it to Demetrius. Now both men are chasing after Helena who thinks it is a joke. Everything calms down after Oberon stops the spells on both Lysander and Titania, and the play ends with all 3 weddings happening at the same time, the actors delivering a terrible play, and Puck breaking the fourth wall to make us question if it was all a midsummer night's dream.

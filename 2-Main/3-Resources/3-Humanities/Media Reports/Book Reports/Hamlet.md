# Hamlet 
#Report/Book #Ela/Classic/Old  

## Summary 

Written by [[William Shakespeare]], Hamlet is a Norwegian prince who studied in London till learning that his father had been killed. His father had been killed by his brother, who then went on to marry his wife. Throughout the book Hamlet understands this and tries to kill his uncle while causing several deaths including that of his fiancé. Hamlet first figures out this from the ghost of his father. In the end Hamlet dies leaving the throne to their enemy who they were fighting a war with.

## Interesting Points

Hamlet is not a good person, yes this is common, especially nowadays, but back in the time not very much. We see him continuously make bad discissions which lead to his downfall. 

I did not very much like the ghost, there seem to be more things that could have been done with that plot point like it being still alive or just not including it. Hamlet could have figured out who the person who killed his father was by still having the play and looking at everyone, this could lead to further issues of whether or not he wanted to kill his uncle.

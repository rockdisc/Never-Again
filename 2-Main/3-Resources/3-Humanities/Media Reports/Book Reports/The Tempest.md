# The Tempest 
#Ela/Classic/Old #Report/Book 

## Summary 

A play by [[William Shakespeare]]. It is one of this last plays. It is neither a tragedy or a comedy, but both called a tragic comedy. It started with a king, prince, his brother, his cousin, butler, councilor, and jester on a ship during a tempest. They are forced to make landfall, now with the ship destroyed, the 4 advisors, the jester, and the king were on one side of island with the prince separated. The storm was caused by Prospero who is a wizard that controls a spirit named Ariel who made the storm, but he did not kill anyone has he is actually the rightful duke of Milan. He was conspired against because he spent too much time reading magics so he and his daughter were exiled to this island. In a reverse of the evil wizard trope, he wants his daughter to fall in love with the prince and take the throne, which does end up happening with the subplot of a comedic trio who get left on the island and the advisors that want to take his throne are not taken care of. 

## Interesting Points

Prospero is in the background making everything happen, a lot of scholars think that he may be a self insert character for Shakespeare himself. As this was one of his last plays it makes sense as he gives up magic in the end.
	"But this rough magic  
	I here abjure. And, when I have required  
	Some heavenly music—which even now I do—  
	To work mine end upon their senses that  
	This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff,  
	Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,  
	And deeper than did ever plummet sound  
	I’ll drown my book."
This can also explain the reason that all the enemies were not delt with as that is what happened in his own life. This can also mean that he thought of his craft as magic and a sacred art which got him to where he is now. This also shows his [[Muse]] with Ariel.

— _Ariel, Act I, Scene II

This is just a tough quote.

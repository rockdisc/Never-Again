# Macbeth 
#Report/Book #Ela/Classic/Old  

## Summary 

Set in Scotland, this [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearian]] play was though to be cursed as it had to do with curses. It may be one of the most infamous tragedies from the playwright. It starts with Macbeth talking to three witches who promise him that he will be thane of Cawdor and later king of Scotland. He initially does not believe this until he is offered the position of thane. After telling his wife, she spurs him to take his destiny into his own hands and kill the king who is in his castle and push some of the blame onto the princes. He becomes drunk on power and kills anyone who opposes him to the point where his wife kills herself in guilt. He later learns from the witches that he can only die when the trees in the forest come to kill him and with a man who is not born from a woman. One of the princes comes using branches from the trees as though they are moving and due to them being born of a C-section they are not born of a woman. 
## Interesting Points

The magic in this story is much better than in [[Hamlet]] as it comes into play several times and shows the problems with destiny.

> **"I am in blood  
> Stepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more,  
> Returning were as tedious as go o’er."**  
> — _Act 3, Scene 4_

Macbeth is a tragic hero who shows that he cannot go back to the times of peace as he has stepped to far into murder. This is also seen in The Prince by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]:

> **"Those who become princes by their own abilities and not by fortune have a hard time gaining power but keep it easily."**  
— _The Prince_, Chapter 6

The opposite applies in this case, as Macbeth gained power with easy, he had to spend time and kill all those who were loyal to the old king and could oppose him.

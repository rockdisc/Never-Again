## Summary 


Taking place in the United States during the times of [[Scalp Hunting]] its main character does not have a name, only being called the Boy. It is a story you structure yourself as there is no punctuation. Several terrible events happen in the story as it shows the horrors of the time with distinct language. The Boy is taken in by scalp hunters who teach the boy how to do exactly that massacring natives as they go and several other horrible things. Every single person in the story is a terrible person, but the worst of all is Judge Holden who is shown as a tall albino hairless man who does the worst things in the book

## Interesting Points

The Philosophy of Judge Holden is very egotistical but interesting as he states that:
> "Whatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent"

As states this is very egotistical yet shows that he does want to know everything in the world and has a god complex.

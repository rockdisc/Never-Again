# Julius Caesar (Play)
#Report/Book #Ela/Classic/Old 

## Summary 

A tragedy by [[William Shakespeare]] about the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]]. Brutus, his friend was tricked by Cassius into doing the assassination with several other people. Cassius loathed that he was not the one that got the glory, and that Julius was constantly saying no to the crown. Even after his death, the play does not end, but keeps going till both Brutus and Cassius die in the conflict where Mark Anthony, a person they ignored, gets crowned king. He calls Brutus the noblest Roman of all. 

## Interesting Points

Though this is a tragedy, the main characters where actually on the wrong side of conflict, if there is one, as Cassius supported tyranny and corruption. The only truly good people in this play were Brutus and Mark Anthony who were on different sides of the war.

Within a speech where Mark Anthony could not speak bad of Cassius, he is still able to make the public go against them.

> **Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;**  
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.  
The evil that men do lives after them;  
The good is oft interred with their bones;  
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus  
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:  
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,  
And grievously hath Caesar answered it.  
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest—  
For Brutus is an honourable man;  
So are they all, all honourable men—  
Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.  
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:  
But Brutus says he was ambitious,  
And Brutus is an honourable man.  
He hath brought many captives home to Rome  
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:  
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?  
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:  
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.  
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,  
And Brutus is an honourable man.  
You all did see that on the Lupercal  
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,  
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?  
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,  
And sure he is an honourable man.  
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,  
But here am I to speak what I do know.  
You all did love him once, not without cause:  
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?  
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,  
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;  
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,  
And I must pause till it come back to me.

There are 3 appeals. They are used in [[Rhetorical Analysis]] to be a way of convincing the audience. All good pieces of media have one or more of these. They are even in debate. 

- Ethos 
This is an appeal of trust or reliability. You can trust this source because they are reliable and so on. 
- Pathos 
This is an emotional appeal. This can convince the audience by making them feel sad or happy or any other emotion. 
- Logos 
Something based in logic, you do not need to listen to me, just think and you will come to the same conclusion, or I can teach you how to get there. 

Combining the appeals is how you make a good argument

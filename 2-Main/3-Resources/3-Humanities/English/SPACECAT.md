## SPA 

- S - Speaker 
This is from generic [[Rhetorical Analysis]], it is who they are, and their persona. 
- P - Purpose 
Again from the same source. It is why the speaker is writing this to the audience. This is most often found near the end of your analysis.
- A - Audience 
Who is this media to? 

## CE 

- C - Context 
What is the time and place of the piece? What events are happening, or what was the connotation of the artform during the time the piece was made. 
- E - Exigence 
Why did they write it then? What was special, which lead to the person deciding to write it then. 

## CAT 

- C - Choices 
What choices in structure, devices, [[DIDS]] did the person use, and why? 
- A - Appeals 
What [[Rhetorical Appeals]] did the speaker make? 
- T - Tone

The last three are separate from the others. They are small things the author can do to effect their writings. The appeals are first, then in an umbrella below it, there is tone, below that is choices.

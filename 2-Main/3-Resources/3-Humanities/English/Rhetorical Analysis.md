Rhetorical, according to [[Aristotle]] means "the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion." For the more modern way of saying it: "Techniques of language used to convey a point of convince an audience." 

Rhetoric needs 3 things to be considered good:
- Occasion 
Knowing when to use it.
- Context 
Knowing where to use it.
- Purpose
Knowing how and why to use it.

## Rhetorical Trangle

- The speaker is not who the person speaking actually is, but who they convey to be. This is called the [[Persona]].
- The subject or message is what the speaker is trying to convey to the audience. This may not be what they actually say, but the message they want the audience to leave with. This is the purpose.
- The audience are the people the speaker wanted to consume the media. This does not have to be the person that is currently consuming this. For example this is only for me to read again, though it could be someone else. If it is, there may be things they do not understand. 
It should be used in tandem with [[Writing Style]].

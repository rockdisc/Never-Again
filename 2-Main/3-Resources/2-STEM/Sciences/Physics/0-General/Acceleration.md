A [[Scalar and Vector|vector]] quantity that shows change of [[Velocity]] over [[Time]] ^de28d2

$$
Acceleration= \frac{ change \space in \space velocity}{Time}= \frac{v _{f}- v_{i}}{t} 
$$

v<sub>f</sub> = final velocity
v<sub>i</sub> = initial velocity  ^81b4ee

If acceleration is done over a small time interval, it is considered instantaneous acceleration, an acceleration at a specific time

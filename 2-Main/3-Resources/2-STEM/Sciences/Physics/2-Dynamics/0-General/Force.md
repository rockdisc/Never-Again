#Science/Physics 

Any interaction that can make an object start or stop moving, or make it keep moving. Forces are always [[Scalar and Vector|Vectors]].

Contact forces are from things touching or colliding.

[[Fundamental Forces]] need a further explanation.

Noncontact/Field forces are can be from a distance like [[Electromagnetism]] and [[Gravity]].

Contact forces are really Field forced on a macroscopic level.

There only really 4 forces, all others are just disguising themselves as other types.

To measure forces we use the Newton:

$$
1N=1kg \space \cdot \space \frac{m}{s^2}
$$

^b442e0

$$
1 \space Newton = 1 \space kilogram \space \cdot \space meters / second^2
$$
The force required to move an object that is 1 kg by 1 meter per second

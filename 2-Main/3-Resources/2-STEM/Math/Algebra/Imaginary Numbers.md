#Math 

When [[Polynomials]] are solved for using things like the [[Quadratic Formula]], there are some times where the square root is a negative. Negative square roots do not exist, so we imagined them. 
$$
i=\sqrt{ -1 }
$$
They come in pairs
$$
1\pm i
$$
You can have a pair of complex terms:
$$
\pm 1 \pm i
$$

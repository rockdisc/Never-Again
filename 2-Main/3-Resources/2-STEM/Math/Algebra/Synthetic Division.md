## Synthetic Division
![[Synthetic Division Example]]
The answer to the divisor is put in the left most box. The coefficients are put in that order. You bring the first one down, then multiply it by the answer to the divisor, then put that in the next box, and so on. The last number on the bottom is the remainder, so we ignore that when formatting and start with the $c$ at the second value. It can only be used if the factors are linear $(x-k)$. The remainder is just called the remainder. It has more uses in the [[Remainder Theorem]].

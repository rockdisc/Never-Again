$$
y=\frac{1}{x}
$$
Follows all the regular [[Functions]] rules. It also has an [[Asymptote]]. 
the bottom term cannot be zero, that is a discontinuity. 

End behavior is decided by the leading [[Polynomials]] digit. These below are the [[Exponent]] of the term:

| Numerator and Denominator | Horizontal Asymptote                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| n = d                     | $f(x)$ has it at $y= \frac{n}{d}$                                      |
| n < d                     | $f(x)$ is at $y=0$                                                     |
| n > d                     | There is no horizontal asymptote, instead there is a slant asymptote.  |

Slant asymptotes are pretty simple, find the equation for it by first [[Finding Roots]] of the denominator, then use [[Long Polynomial Division]] or [[Synthetic Division]] to get the final equation, forget about the remainder. 

Inequalities are about the same, [[Factor]] out both the equations to get the roots(Numerator) and discontinuities(Denominator), and make a sign chart to find what the equation is asking for. 

Vertical [[Asymptote]]s are found through looking at the NOT canceled out terms in the numerator and denominator: EX.
$$
f(x) = \frac{(x-2)(x+4)}{(x-2)(x+13)}
$$
the VA is $(x+13)$ or -13.

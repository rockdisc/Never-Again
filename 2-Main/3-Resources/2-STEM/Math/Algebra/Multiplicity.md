In [[Parabola]]s, and other [[Polynomials]], there are points where it looks like the line bounces or pauses and keeps going. These are points with multiplicity. Even is a bounce and odd is a pause. Multiplicity just means there the answer is repeated. Like in $x^2+2x+1=0$ when $x=-1$ twice. That has a multiplicity of 2.

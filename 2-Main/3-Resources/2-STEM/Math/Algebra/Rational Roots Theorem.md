#Math/Algebra 

A way of [[Finding Roots]]. It specifically says:
Suppose $f$ is a [[Polynomials]] [[Functions]] of degree $\geq$ 1, in standard form. If $p$ is an [[Integer]] factor of the constant and $q$ is an integer factor of the leading coefficient term then $x=\frac{p}{q}$ will be a possible rational zero of the polynomial. 
Aka put the ending coefficient factors over the leading coefficient factors and they are all the possible rational roots. 
In $ax^2+bx+c$
$$
x=\pm \frac{factors \space of \space c}{factors \space of \space a}
$$

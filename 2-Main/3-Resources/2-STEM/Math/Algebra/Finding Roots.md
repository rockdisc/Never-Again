#Math/Algebra 

Roots are where the function is at 0. This is how to find them in long [[Polynomials]]. 

1. Identify the total number of roots, the degree 
2. Graph the function and identify any root, use [[Rational Roots Theorem]] if needed. 
3. Use [[Synthetic Division]], [[Long Polynomial Division]], or [[Quadratic Formula]] to verify all roots. 

Here is an example:

Everything should be self explanatory.
